## Abstract

A method is proposed to use value theory to select and quantitatively prioritize actions to accomplish a goal. Actions are relatively ranked based on some quantitative measurement(s) as called for by the value theory. This ranking is transformed by a set of functions which scale up and down each actionâ€™s relative score based on other relevant measurements and subjective opinions. The resulting list provides a prioritized relative ranking of actions that should be pursued in a particular order. This method is applied to the example of choosing meaningful work using an example value system based on the goal to reduce human suffering.

Keywords: meaning, values, work, prioritization, suffering
