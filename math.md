# Math

[Math][] is the study of topics such as quantity, structure, space, and change.

A variable is a letter that represents a quantity whose value is unknown.

## Multiplication

[Multiplication][] (<code>A × B</code>) represents some number A of equal-sized *groups*, each of size B. The multiplication symbol (×) may be implied by simply joining the numbers or variables (<code>AB</code>).

## Decimals

A decimal represents a number using powers of 10 based on the position of each digit:

<code>d<sub>1</sub>d<sub>2</sub>.d<sub>3</sub>d<sub>4</sub> = d<sub>1</sub>×10<sup>1</sup> + d<sub>2</sub>×10<sup>0</sup> + d<sub>3</sub>×10<sup>-1</sup> + d<sub>4</sub>×10<sup>-2</sup></code>

## Numbers

* The ratio of one quantity to another is a way to express their relative sizes, often in the form of a fraction (<code>a/b</code>), where the first quantity is the numerator and the second quantity is the denominator (also expressed as "numerator to denominator" or "numerator : denominator").
* A rational number is a ratio of integers. Every rational number may be expressed as a terminating or repeating decimal.
* An irrational number is a decimal that does not terminate nor repeat.
* A real number is either a rational or an irrational number.
* A fractional expression is a fraction that may also use non-integers.
* Fractional expressions may be added or subtracted if they have the same denominator.
* A fraction is not defined when the denominator is 0.
* A mixed number with an integer followed by a fraction is equivalent to the integer plus the fraction.
* An integer is prime if it is only divisible by two positive integers: 1 and itself. The number 1 itself is not prime. Integers greater than 1 that are not prime are composite numbers.
* A proportion is an equation relating two ratios.
* A percent means per hundred.
* Percent change is the amount of the increase or decrease divided by the initial amount.

## Exponents

* <code>a<sup>0</sup> = 0</code>
* <code>a<sup>-x</sup> = 1 / a<sup>x</sup></code>
* <code>(a<sup>x</sup>)(a<sup>y</sup>) = a<sup>x+y</sup></code>
* <code>(a<sup>x</sup>) / (a<sup>y</sup>) = a<sup>x-y</sup> = 1 / a<sup>y-x</sup></code>
* <code>(a<sup>x</sup>)<sup>y</sup> = a<sup>xy</sup></code>
* <code>(a<sup>x</sup>)(b<sup>x</sup>) = (ab)<sup>x</sup></code>
* <code>(a / b)<sup>x</sup> = a<sup>x</sup> / b<sup>x</sup></code>

## Roots

* An <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> root of a nonnegative number <code>a</code> is a number <code>b</code> such that <code>b<sup>n</sup> = a</code>.
* <code>(√a)<sup>2</sup> = a</code>
* <code>√(a<sup>2</sup>) = a</code>
* <code>√a × √b = √(a × b)</code>
* <code>√a / √b = √(a / b)</code>
* <code>∜a = √(√a)</code>
* The square root of a negative number is not a real number.
* For odd order roots, there is exactly one root for every number n, even when n is negative.
* For even order roots, there are exactly two roots for every positive number n and no roots for any negative number n.

## Algebra

* An algebraic expression consists of one or more terms. A term without a variable is a constant term. A number that is multiplied by variables is called the coefficient of a term.
* A polynomial is an expression in which each term is either a constant term or a product of a coefficient and one or more variables with positive integer exponents.
* Terms that have the same set of variables with the same exponents are called like terms and may be added together by coefficients.
* The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of its variables.
* To multiply two algebraic expressions, each term of the first expression is multiplied by each term of the second expression and the results are added.
* <code>ca + cb = c(a + b)</code>
* <code>ca − cb = c(a − b)</code>
* <code>a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> = (a + b)(a - b)</code>
* <code>(a + b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></code>
* <code>(a - b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></code>
* <code>(a + b)<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>3</sup> + 3a<sup>2</sup>b + 3ab<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>3</sup></code>
* <code>(a - b)<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>3</sup> - 3a<sup>2</sup>b + 3ab<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>3</sup></code>
* If <code>x<sup>a</sup> = x<sup>b</sup></code>, then <code>a = b</code>

## Equations

* An equation is a statement of equality or inequality between two expressions.
* A non-zero constant may be added to both sides.
* Both sides may be multiplied or divided by the same non-zero constant. For non-equalities, if the constant is negative, the direction of the equality flips.
* The triangle equality shows that <code>|r+s| <= |r|+|s|</code>
* A linear equation has a maximum degree of 1 and none of the terms have more than one variable.
* A quadratic equation is of the form <code>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</code> and has 0, 1, or 2 solutions.
* Quadratic formula: <code>x = (-b ± √(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)) / 2a</code>

## Functions

* A function f(x) represents an equation with a particular value of x. The domain of a function is the set of permissible inputs such as all real numbers.

## Interest

* Interest is computed on a principle (P) base amount to calculate a final amount over a time period.
* A simple interest at an annual percent <code>r</code> for time <code>t</code> (in years) is calculated as <code>P(1 + (rt/100))</code>
* A compound interest at an annual percent <code>r</code> for time <code>t</code> (in years) is calculated as <code>P(1 + (r/100))<sup>t</sup></code>
  * If compound interest is compounded <code>n</code> times per year: <code>P(1 + (r/100n))<sup>nt</sup></code>

## Geometry

* A graph of the linear equation <code>y = mx + b</code> is a straight line where <code>m</code> is the slope (rise over run) and <code>b</code> is the y-intercept.
* The slope of a line passing through two points (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) is <code>(y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)</code>
* Two lines are parallel (∥) if their slopes are equal.
* Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other.
* Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length.
* The graph of an equation of the form <code>(x - a)<sup>2</sup> + (y - b)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup></code> is a circle with a center at <code>(a, b)</code>
* When two lines intersect, four angles (∠) are formed. If the lines are perpendicular (⟂), the angles are 90° and are called right angles.
* A polygon is a closed figure formed by three or more line segments (sides), joined at vertices.
* A triangle has three sides, quadrilateral has four sides, pentagon has five sides, hexagon has six sides, etc.
* The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°. A triangle with three congruent sides is an equilateral triangle. A triangle with two congruent sides sides is an isosceles triangle.
* A polygon with <code>n</code> sides can be divided into <code>n - 2</code> triangles. The sum of the measures of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is <code>(n-2)(180°)</code>
* A regular polygon is one in which all sides and angles are congruent.
* A right triangle occurs when one angle is 90°. The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle, the relationship between (a, b) and the hypotenuse (c) is <code>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></code>
* The area of a triangle is <code>bh/2</code> where <code>b</code> is the length of any side as the base <code>b</code> and the height <code>h</code> is the length of a perpendicular line from the base to the opposite vertex.
* If two sides and the included angle are congruent across triangles, then the triangles are congruent. Similarly for two angles and the included side.
* A quadrilateral with right angles is a rectangle. If all sides are also congruent, it's a square. A quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel is called a parallelogram and the area is <code>bh</code>. If at least one pair of opposite sides are parallel, it's a trapezoid and the area is <code>0.5h(b<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>)</code>.

### Circles

* Given a center point, a circle is the set of all points that are a distance of the radius <code>r</code> from the center.
* The circle diamter is <code>2r</code>
* A line segment joining two points of a circle is a chord.
* The distance around a circle is the circumference (C) and the ratio of the circumference to the diamter is <code>π = C/d</code> and is approximately <code>22/7</code>
* The area of a circle is <code>πr<sup>2</sup></code>
* Given two points on a circle, an arc contains those two points and all of the points in between.
* The central angle (c∠) is an angle with its vertex at the center.
* The length of an arc (l) can be calculated with the proportion that <code>l/C = c∠/360</code>
* A sector is bounded by an arc and its radii. The area of a sector (S) can be calculated with the proportion that <code>s/πr<sup>2</sup> = c∠/360</code>

### Three-Dimensional Figures

* A rectangular solid (or prism) has 6 surfaces called faces. The volume is <code>lwh</code>. The surface area is <code>2(lw + lh + wh)</code>
* A circular cylinder has two circle bases in parallel and a lateral surface made of all line segments that join points on the two circles. An axis is the hypothetical line segment joining the two centers.
* A right circular cylinder's axis is perpendicular to its bases. The volume is <code>πr<sup>2</sup>h</code>. The surface area is <code>2πr<sup>2</sup> + 2πrh</code>

## Data Analysis

* In data analysis, a variable is a characteristic that varies for a set of data. Variables are either numerical (quantitative) or nonnumerical (categorical).
* The distribution of data indicates how frequently different values appear in the data.
* The frequency (or count) indicates the number of times different values appear in the data.
* A frequency distribution represents all values and their frequencies.
* The relative frequency if the frequency divided by the total. A relative frequency distribution represents all relative frequencies.
* Different values may be put into equal sized groups (or classes or intervals) and graphed in a histogram.
* A scatterplot graphs the relationship between numerical variables.
* Central tendencies indicate the "center" of values. The arithmetic mean (or average) is the sum of values divided by the number of values.
* The number of times a value occurs is also called the weight of the value.
* The median is the middle number in the list of values after it has been sorted. If the number of values is even, the middle two numbers are averaged.
* The mode of a list of values is the value with the highest frequency or weight.
* Quartiles are numbers that divide a list of ordered values. The three quartiles are the first, second and third quartiles where the first and third are medians after splitting the data in two, and the second quartile is the total median. 99 percentile numbers split the data into 100 roughly equal groups.
* Measures of dispersion indicate the degree of spread of the data.
* The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values. The interquartile range is the difference between the first and third quartiles.
* A boxplot (or box-and-whiskers plot) shows a box from the first to second quartile, a box from the second to third quartile, and whiskers to the lowest and greatest values.
* Standard deviation (or population standard deviation) measures how much each value differs from the mean and takes a type of average of these differences.
* A sample standard deviation is used when a subset of all data is used where the sum of squared differences is divided by <code>n - 1</code> instead.

## Sets

* The inclusion-exclusion principle states that the number of elements in the union of two sets equals the sum of their individual numbers of elements minus the number of elements in their intersection: <code>|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| + |A ∩ B|</code>
* The multiplication principle states that a number of independent choices to be made from groups of options, the total possible options is the multiplication of the sizes of the groups.
* A permutation with the n-factorial symbol <code>n!</code> is <code>n(n-1)(n-2)...(1)</code>
* If the choices are dependent (choosing one means that it can't be chosen in the future) from a set of size k, then the multiplication occurs with one less size of the group on each iteration: <code>n! / (n - k)!</code>, denoted <code><sub>n</sub>P<sub>k</sub></code>
* If the order doesn't matter, then the search is for combinations which is <code>n! / (k!(n - k)!)</code>, denoted "n choose k" or <code><sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub></code> or:
  
  <pre>
  ⎛n⎞
  ⎝k⎠</pre>

## Probability

Probability is a way of describing uncertainty in numerical terms. A probability experiment (or random experiment) is an experiment in which the outcome is uncertain. The set of possible outcomes is the sample space. An outcome is an event. The probability of an event (<code>P(E)</code>) is a number from 0 to 1.

For a random experiment with a finite number of possible outcomes, if each out come is equally likely, then <code>P(E) = (outcomes in E) / (total possible outcomes)</code>

* If E and F are mututally exclusive, <code>P(E or F) = P(E) + P(F)</code>
* If E and F are not mututally exclusive, <code>P(E or F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E and F)</code>
* E and F are independent if either event does not affect the occurrence of the other. If E and F are independent, <code>P(E and F) = P(E)P(F)</code>
* If E and F are not independent, <code>P(E and F) = P(E)P(F|E)</code>
