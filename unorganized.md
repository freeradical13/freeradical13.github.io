A [polymer][] is a molecule made of repeating parts called [monomers][] connected by covalent bonds. The process of creating polymers from monomers is called [polymerization][]. A monomer is simply a molecule that can undergo polymerization. A homopolymer is created from just one type of monomer, whereas [copolymers][] may be created from more than one type of monomer. [Oligomers][] are polymers of a small, fixed number of monomers (e.g. [dimers][], [trimers][], [tetramers][], etc.).

A [macromolecule][] is a large molecule, often a large polymer. The most common biological macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Lipids are not polymers because they aren't made of monomers connected by covalent bonds.

Polymers are assembled through a process called [dehydration synthesis][] (or [condensation][] or Zimmer's hydrogensis) in which energy is consumed when two Hydrogens and an Oxygen at the ends of two monomers combine to form water, leaving the remaining monomers to covalently bond. [Hydrolysis][] is the opposite reaction.

If functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain, they are called [cis-][cis-trans isomerisms] (often represented as E), whereas [trans-][cis-trans isomerisms] are on opposed sides (often represented as Z). In general, such groups contain double bonds.

A [methyl group][] is CH<sub>3</sub> on an alkyl.

A [hydride][] is a Hydrogen anion (H<sup>-</sup>). A [tetrahydride][] is a group 14 element (e.g. C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, etc.) which is saturated with hydrogens (e.g. CH<sub>4</sub>). Tetrahydrides are considered non-polar.

[Ammonia][] is NH<sub>3</sub>. It has three covalent bonds with Hydrogen which leaves one lone electron pair (because there are 5 total valence electrons: 2s<sup>2</sup> + 2s<sup>3</sup>). This lone electron pair makes it a base because it can accept protons. Ammonia is also polar because Nitrogen is much more electronegative than Hydrogen, but also because the shape of Ammonia is pyramidal. If it was planar, the dipoles would cancel out, but the lone pair pushes the other Hydrogens out into a pyramidal structure.
