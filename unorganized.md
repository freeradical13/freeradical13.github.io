A [polymer][] is a molecule made of repeating parts called [monomers][] connected by covalent bonds. The process of creating polymers from monomers is called [polymerization][]. A monomer is simply a molecule that can undergo polymerization. A homopolymer is created from just one type of monomer, whereas [copolymers][] may be created from more than one type of monomer. [Oligomers][] are polymers of a small, fixed number of monomers (e.g. [dimers][], [trimers][], [tetramers][], etc.).

A [macromolecule][] is a large molecule, often a large polymer. The most common biological macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Lipids are not polymers because they aren't made of monomers connected by covalent bonds.

Polymers are assembled through a process called [dehydration synthesis][] (or [condensation][] or Zimmer's hydrogensis) in which energy is consumed when two Hydrogens and an Oxygen at the ends of two monomers combine to form water, leaving the remaining monomers to covalently bond. [Hydrolysis][] is the opposite reaction.

The electronegativities between Hydrogen and Carbon are close enough that [hydrocarbons are generally considered non-polar][hydrocarbons non-polar].

A [saturated hydrocarbon][] has no double or triple bonds (i.e. saturated with the maximum number of Hydrogens). An [unsaturated hydrocarbon][] has double or triple bonds between Carbons.

An [alkane][] is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon. An example is [Methane][] which is CH<sub>4</sub> and is the main component of [natural gas][]. A straight-chain alkane has the suffix [-ane][alkane suffix].

An [alkene][] (or olefin) is an unsaturated alkane with at least one C=C double bond. An [alkyne][] is an unsaturated alkane with at least one Câ‰¡C triple bond. The [position of the double or triple bond][unsaturated hydrocarbon] is written at the start of the name or before the -ene or -yne suffix. If there are more than one such bonds, the positions are comma separated (e.g. 2,4-pentadiene). A substance that's both an alkene and alkyne has the suffix -enyne.

An [alkyl][] is an alkane missing one Hydrogen. If a molecule contains an alkyl and some functional group(s), the alkyl may be represented with the R symbo as short-hand.

The longest series of linked carbons is known as its parent chain, [carbon skeleton][] or carbon backbone. Alkanes are not very reactive and act mostly as backbones. The number of carbon atoms may be thought of as the size of the alkane. Any smaller alkanes that branch off are called side chains.

The number of Carbons in the skeleton of an alkane have the [prefixes][alkane prefixes]:

* 1: Meth-
* 2: Eth-
* 3: Prop-
* 4: But-
* 5: Pent-
* 6: Hex-
* 7: Hept-
* 8: Oct-
* 9: Non-
* 10: Dec-
* 11: Undec-
* 12: Dodec-
* 13: Tridec-
* 14: Tetradec-
* 15: Pentadec-
* 16: Hexadec-
* 17: Heptadec-
* 18: Octadec-
* 20: Eicos-
* 22: Docos-
* 23: Tricosa-
* 24: Tetracos-
* 26: Hexacos-
* 28: Octacos-
* 30: Triacont-
* 32: Dotriacont-
* 33: Tritriacont-
* 34: Tetratriacont-
* 35: Pentatriacont-
* 40: Tetracont-
* 50: Pentacont-
* 60: Hexacont-
* 70: Heptacont-
* 80: Octacont-
* 90: Nonacont-
* 100: Hect-

Cyclic alkanes are prefixed with cyclo-.

If functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain, they are called [cis-][cis-trans isomerisms] (often represented as E), whereas [trans-][cis-trans isomerisms] are on opposed sides (often represented as Z). In general, such groups contain double bonds.

[Naming an organic compound][]:

* An alkane with branched groups is prefixed with the position of the Carbon where the branch occurs, followed by a prefix for the branched group, followed by the name of the alkane chain.
* If there are multiple branches, the number prefix is a comma-separated list and the branch prefix is prefixed with di-, tri-, tetra-, etc. for the number of groups.
* If the multiple branches are different types of groups, they're ordered in alphabetical order.
* For alkenes and alkynes, the position(s) of the double or triple bonds are a comma separated list infixed in the name, and a prefix of di-, tri- etcs before the final prefix.
* Prefix cis- or trans- if needing to describe the isomerism.

A [methyl group][] is CH<sub>3</sub> on an alkyl.

A [hydride][] is a Hydrogen anion (H<sup>-</sup>). A [tetrahydride][] is a group 14 element (e.g. C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, etc.) which is saturated with hydrogens (e.g. CH<sub>4</sub>). Tetrahydrides are considered non-polar.

[Ammonia][] is NH<sub>3</sub>. It has three covalent bonds with Hydrogen which leaves one lone electron pair (because there are 5 total valence electrons: 2s<sup>2</sup> + 2s<sup>3</sup>). This lone electron pair makes it a base because it can accept protons. Ammonia is also polar because Nitrogen is much more electronegative than Hydrogen, but also because the shape of Ammonia is pyramidal. If it was planar, the dipoles would cancel out, but the lone pair pushes the other Hydrogens out into a pyramidal structure.

A [thiol][] (<code>R-S-H</code>) is an alkyl (represented by R) bonded to a sulfhydride (Sulfur bonded with a Hydrogen). This is similar to a hydroxyl group.

Hexane is an alkane with 6 Carbons.

Butane is an alkane with 4 Carbons.

Hydrocarbons are either [aliphatic][] or [aromatic][] (also known as arenes or aryls). Only aromatics have stable cyclic arrangements, so most aliphatics are acyclic.
