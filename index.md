# Biology Basics

The purpose of this site is to explore biology and the things that make up biology. Feel free to [correct or suggest 
things][issues]. You may follow updates to this page using [an RSS 
feed](https://github.com/freeradical13/freeradical13.github.io/commits/master/index.md.atom).

# Big History

The [universe][] is at least 13.7 billion years old and more than 100 billion [light years][] in [diameter][].

We live on [Earth][] which is part of a [solar system][] with a [star][] at its center called the [Sun][]. Earth and 
its star formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's solar system is part of the [Milky Way galaxy][], which is at least 
12 billion years old, contains over 100 billion stars and 100 billion [planets][], and is over 100,000 light years in 
diameter (or about 0.0001% of the size of the universe).

There are over 100 billion [galaxies][] in the universe.

# Basics

1. This page assumes basic knowledge of [math][], [algebra][], [geometry][], and [scientific notation][].
1. A [unit of measurement][] followed by a letter in parentheses - for example, "mass (m)" - defines a variable in the 
parentheses (in this example, "m") which represents that measurement in equations. In this example, in the equation 
<code>F=m×a</code>, mass is represented by the letter "m".

# Matter

The universe is made of [matter][] which is something that has [mass][] (m) and takes up a position in [space][].

Examples of matter are [protons][], [electrons][], and [neutrons][]. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 
1.6×10<sup>−27</sup> [kilograms][] (kg), whereas electrons have a much smaller mass of about 
9.1×10<sup>−31</sup> kg. [Protons][proton radius] and [neutrons][neutron radius] each have a [radius][] of about 
0.8×10<sup>−15</sup> [meters][] (m), whereas electrons have a radius of less than [1.0×10<sup>−22</sup>][electron 
radius].

An [object][] is a collection of matter. An object has an [inertia][], meaning:

1. An object at rest will stay at rest unless a [force][] (F) is applied to push or pull it, and
2. An object in motion will stay in motion unless a force is applied to push or pull it.

The [speed][] of an object is a description of its movement which is the [rate][] at which its position in space 
changes over a [distance][] over a period of [time][] ([e.g.][for example] moving at 13 meters per [second][] (s), or 13 
m/s).

The [velocity][] (v) of an object is a description of both its speed and its [direction][] in space (e.g. moving at 13 
m/s _down_).

The [acceleration][] (a) of an object is the rate at which its velocity changes over a period of time (e.g. 
accelerating at 13 m/s over 1 second down, or 13 m/s<sup>2</sup> down).

The [momentum][] (p) of an object, or its "quantity of motion", is its mass multiplied by its velocity 
(<code>p=m×v</code>).

If the mass of an object is constant, the force acting on it is the [rate of change][derivative] of its momentum over 
time (<code>F=<span class="italics">d</span>p/<span class="italics">d</span>t</code>); or, substituting momentum for 
acceleration and simplifying, its mass multiplied by its acceleration (<code>F=m×a</code>). The unit of force is the 
[newton][] (N).

When objects touch each other, the [perpendicular][] force their surfaces apply is called the [normal force][] 
(F<sub>n</sub>), and any [parallel][] forces are called [frictional forces][] (F<sub>f</sub>).

When an object A exerts a force on another object B, then object B exerts an [equal and opposite force][force third 
law] on object A.

# Electric Charge

[Electric charge][] is the property of some forms of matter to create an [electromagnetic field][] which applies a 
positive or negative force on other electrically charged matter, proportional to the distance between them. The 
magnitude of the force is calculated with [Coulomb's law][] 
(<code>F=k<sub>e</sub>×((q<sub>1</sub>×q<sub>2</sub>)/r<sup>2</sup>)</code>) which is [Coulomb's constant][] 
(k<sub>e</sub>) multiplied by the magnitudes of the two charges involved (q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub>) and divided 
by the square of the distance between the two objects (r<sup>2</sup>). This equation means that positive charges repel 
other positive charges, negative charges repel other negative charges, and positive charges attract negative charges 
(and vice versa).

Examples of electrically charged matter are protons, which are positively charged, and electrons, which are negatively 
charged. Protons and electrons have the same magnitude [elementary electric charge][], denoted 1e and -1e, 
respectively. Neutrons have no charge (electrically neutral).

An electromagnetic field creates [electromagnetic radiation][] which is a [wave][] of its force traveling (radiating) 
through space. A wave represents something that repeats over time at a [frequency][] which is how often it repeats (a 
cycle) per unit time (e.g. one cycle per second). If the unit of time is one second, the unit of frequency is [Hertz][] 
(Hz). [Wavelength][] is the distance the wave covers over one cycle. The maximum speed of electromagntic radiation 
occurs in space without matter (a [vacuum][]) at the [speed of light][] (c), or approximately 3×10<sup>8</sup> m/s. The 
speed of light is the maximum speed that any matter may move.

# Energy

[Energy][] (E) is the amount of work one object performs on, or transfers to, another object. Energy is often measured 
in [joules][] (J). One joule may be defined as <code>J=N×m</code> or a force of one Newton acting on an object in the 
direction of its motion for one meter.

Energy is either [kinetic energy][] if an object is in motion (in most simple cases expressed as 
<code>(m×v<sup>2</sup>)/2</code>); or, [potential energy][], which may be thought of as stored energy.

Energy may [neither be created nor destroyed][conservation of energy], but only transformed. Mass may be converted to 
energy and vice versa through the [mass-energy equivalence][] equation (<code>E=m×c<sup>2</sup></code>).

# Pressure and Temperature

[Pressure][] (P) is the normal force per unit area (A) applied to an object or <code>P=F<sub>n</sub>/A</code>, often 
measured in [Pascals][] (Pa) or N/m<sup>2</sup>. An object under pressure has potential energy.

[Atmospheric pressure][] is the pressure of a planet's atmosphere (e.g. the pressure of [air][]) on an object. The 
mass of air in the Earth's atmosphere [decreases expontentially with altitude][earth air pressure] so the atmospheric 
pressure reduces expontentially as an object rises above [sea level][].

Another unit of pressure is the [atmosphere][atm] (atm) which is the pressure on Earth at sea level and it's equivalent 
to 101,325 Pa.

[Temperature][] is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a set of objects. [Absolute zero][] is the coldest 
state at which an object has minimal movement; however, practically, it may be assumed that all objects have some 
movement (or [vibration][]) and thus some non-zero temperature.

Temperature or heat is either measured in [degrees][] (°) of change on the scale of [Celsius][] (°C) or 
[Fahrenheit][] (°F), or in absolute terms on the scale of [Kelvin][] (K).

Roughly, the scale of celsius is defined with 0°C being when water freezes at 1 atm, 100°C when water boils at 1 
atm, and absolute zero is -273.15°C. The scale of fahrenheit is defined with 32°F being when water freezes 
at 1 atm, 212°F when water boils at 1 atm, and absolute zero is -459.67°F. Originally, the Kelvin scale was defined 
relative to Celsius, but is now defined as pressure invariant, with 0 as absolute zero, and 273.16K when water reaches 
its [triple point][]. Kelvin was designed so that an increase of one Kelvin is equal to an increase of 1°C.

The [lowest recorded surface temperature][temperature comparison] on Earth is 184K / -89.2°C / -128.6°F, the highest 
331K / 58°C / 136.4°F, and the average 288K / 15°C / 59°F.

If two objects touch with a path permeable to heat, then, all else being equal, the hotter object heats the cooler 
object through [thermal conduction][] (and [thermal convection][] in the case of fluids and gases) until they (or at 
least their touching surfaces) reach [thermal equilibrium][].

All matter continuously emits some of its energy as heat through [thermal radiation][].

# Atoms

[Atoms][] are made of some number of [nucleons][] - at least one proton and zero or more neutrons - in the atom's 
[nucleus][], and some number of [electrons][] in [orbitals][] around the nucleus. An [atomic nucleus][atoms] is at least 
10<sup>-10</sup> m in diameter.

The number of protons is considered the [atomic number][] and categorizes the atom as a particular [chemical element][] 
(e.g. carbon which has 6 protons). The number of nucleons is considered the [atomic mass number][atomic mass] (because 
electrons are so much relatively lighter as to contribute insignificantly to mass). The number of neutrons defines the 
element's [isotope][] which is represented as the element name followed by its atomic mass number (e.g. carbon-14), so 
the number of neutrons may be deduced from the isotope name by subtracting the number of protons. There are four main 
[states of matter][]: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.

If an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons, then it is [ionized][ion] (if more protons [positively 
charged], then it's called a cation, and if more electrons [negatively charged], an anion).

## Table of Elements

The [periodic table][] is a way to organize and understand the chemical elements based on observed patterns. The 
elements are ordered by atomic number (number of protons) from left to right.

Rows are called periods and a new period is started when an element starts a new electron orbital (ionized elements 
complicate this picture - for example, the Lithium cation - but the table is primarily conceptual). The outermost 
electron orbital is called the [valence orbital][]. The valence orbital of the first period (encompassing just Hydrogen 
and Helium) may not have more than 2 electrons and the valence orbital of all other elements may not have more than 8 
electrons (although inner orbitals sometimes have more). This is very important because the primary determinant of an 
element's behavior is its electron configuration of its valence orbital. Atoms tend to bond together or chemically react 
in such a way that each atom's valence orbital wants to be "full" - 2 electrons for period 1 and 8 electrons for the 
other periods (the [octet rule][]). This means that columns have generally similar behavior since columns are generally 
grouped by the number of electrons in the valence orbital. There are 18 numbered and 6 named groups:

* Group #1: [Alkali metals][] - Highly reactive because they want to lose/share an electron to drop to the previous 
period's full valance orbital. Hydrogen is an exception because if it loses/shares its electron, it does not drop to 
a full valance orbital but simply has an empty valence orbital.
* Group #2: [Alkaline earth metals][] - Somewhat reactive because they want to lose/share two electrons to drop to the 
previous period's full valence orbital.
* Group #15: [Pnictogens][]
* Group #16: [Chalcogens][] - Somewhat reactive because they want to gain/share two electrons to fill their valance 
orbitals.
* Group #17: [Halogens][] - Highly reactive because they want to gain/share an electron to fill their 
valence orbitals.
* Group #18: [Noble gases][] - Not chemically active ([inert][]) because the valence orbital is full.

[![32-column periodic table](images/32-column_periodic_table-a.png)][periodic table image]

[Ionization energy][] is the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from an element. The ionization energy 
decreases from top to bottom because valence electrons are farther from the nuclear protons (to which they're 
attracted) and thus the electrons are easier to peel off; however, ionization energy increases from left to right 
because elements want to fill their valence orbitals.

[Electronegativity][] is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons to itself in its valence orbital. It follows from 
the octet rule that atoms increase in electronegativity from left to right. Electronegativity decreases from top to 
bottom because the valence orbital is farther away from the positively charged nucleus.

The diameter of an atom increases from top to bottom as electron orbitals are added; however, within a period, moving 
left to right, the diameter of an atom decreases as the additional protons draw in the electrons.

Electron orbitals are broken down into accumulating subshells. These subshells are represented by the orbital number, 
followed by the subshell name, followed by the number of electrons in that subshell in a superscript. For example, 
neutral Hydrogen is 1s<sup>1</sup>. The subshells are:

* s: At most 2 electrons from groups 1 and 2 (or group 18 for Helium).
* p: At most 6 electrons from groups 13-18.
* d: Starting at period 4, at most 10 electrons from groups 3-12.
* f: Starting at period 6, at most 14 electrons from between groups 3 and 4.

Examples:

Hydrogen:  1s<sup>1</sup>
Hydrogen:  1s<sup>2</sup>

Aluminum:  1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>6</sup> 3s<sup>2</sup> 3p<sup>1</sup> [...]

# Big History (Continued)

After the [Big Bang][], the universe was mostly made of hydrogen, helium, and lithium (the first three elements), some 
of which combined into plasma stars held together by [gravity][]. At high enough temperatures inside stars, 
hydrogen atoms undergo [nuclear fusion][] where nuclei (and their protons and neutrons) combine to produce 
[helium][stellar nucleosynthesis]. As the hydrogen is used up to create helium, the star's temperature rises and allows 
for the fusion of [helium into carbon and oxygen][triple alpha process] and some neon and heavier elements. As the star 
temperature continues to increase, nuclear fusion produces elements [up to iron][heavy elements]. The remaining 
elements in the universe are produced by [certain stars' s-processes][s process] and [stars' explosions in a supernova 
or collapses into a black hole or neutron star][r process].

# Chemistry

A [molecule][] is a set of two or more atoms held together by a [chemical bond][].

A [covalent bond][] occurs when atoms share one or more pairs of electrons in their valence orbitals.

An [ionic bond][] occurs when one atom transfer an electron to another. This transfer causes ionization of both 
atoms which then causes attraction.

An [organic compound][] is a molecule that has carbon.

# Biology

Biology is the [study of life][biology history]. The definition of life is [controversial][definition of life].

# History of Life

Oceans formed on Earth about [4.4 billion years ago][history of oceans].

# Cells

A [cell][] is a set of atoms encapsulated in a [membrane][], mostly filled with water. For example, a medium-sized E. 
coli cell has about [35 billion atoms][atoms in e coli] and a human body has about [10<sup>27</sup> atoms][atoms in 
human body].

An [organism][] is a set of one or more cells.
