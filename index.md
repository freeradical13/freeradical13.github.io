# Biology Basics

The purpose of this site is to explore biology and the things that make up biology. Feel free to [correct or suggest 
things][issues]. You may follow updates to this page using [an RSS

# Big History

The [universe][] is at least 13.7 billion years old and more than 100 billion [light years][] in [diameter][].

We live on [Earth][] which is part of a [solar system][] with a [star][] at its center called the [Sun][]. Earth and 
its star formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's solar system is part of the [Milky Way galaxy][], which is at least 
12 billion years old, contains over 100 billion stars and 100 billion [planets][], and is over 100,000 light years in 
diameter (or about 0.0001% of the size of the universe).

There are over 100 billion [galaxies][] in the universe.

# Basics

1. This page assumes basic knowledge of [math][], [algebra][], [geometry][], and [scientific notation][].
1. A [unit of measurement][] followed by a letter in parentheses - for example, "mass (m)" - defines a variable in the 
parentheses (in this example, "m") which represents that measurement in equations. In this example, in the equation 
<code>F=m×a</code>, mass is represented by the letter "m".

# Matter

The universe is made of [matter][] which is something that has [mass][] (m) and takes up a position in [space][].

Examples of matter are [protons][], [electrons][], and [neutrons][]. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 
1.6×10<sup>−27</sup> [kilograms][] (kg), whereas electrons have a much smaller mass of about 
9.1×10<sup>−31</sup> kg. [Protons][proton radius] and [neutrons][neutron radius] each have a [radius][] of about 
0.8×10<sup>−15</sup> [meters][] (m), whereas electrons have a radius of less than [1.0×10<sup>−22</sup>][electron 
radius].

An [object][] is a collection of matter. An object has an [inertia][], meaning:

1. An object at rest will stay at rest unless a [force][] (F) is applied to push or pull it, and
2. An object in motion will stay in motion unless a force is applied to push or pull it.

The [speed][] of an object is a description of its movement which is the [rate][] at which its position in space 
changes over a [distance][] over a period of [time][] ([e.g.][for example] moving at 13 meters per [second][] (s), or 13 
m/s).

The [velocity][] (v) of an object is a description of both its speed and its [direction][] in space (e.g. moving at 13 
m/s down).

The [acceleration][] (a) of an object is the rate at which its velocity changes over a period of time (e.g. 
accelerating at 13 m/s over 1 second, or 13 m/s<sup>2</sup> down).

The [momentum][] (p) of an object, or its "quantity of motion", is its mass multiplied by its velocity 
(<code>p=m×v</code>).

If the mass of an object is constant, the force acting on it is the [rate of change][derivative] of its momentum over 
time (<code>F=<span class="italics">d</span>p/<span class="italics">d</span>t</code>); or, substituting momentum for 
acceleration and simplifying, its mass multiplied by its acceleration (<code>F=m×a</code>). The unit of force is the 
[newton][] (N).

When objects touch each other, the perpendicular force their surfaces apply is called the [normal force][] 
(F<sub>n</sub>), and any parallel forces are called [frictional forces][] (F<sub>f</sub>).

When an object A exerts a force on another object B, then object B exerts an [equal and opposite force][force third 
law] on object A.

# Electric Charge

[Electric charge][] is the property of some forms of matter to create an [electromagnetic field][] which applies a 
positive or negative force on other electrically charged matter. The magnitude of the force is calculated with 
[Coulomb's law][] (<code>F=k<sub>e</sub>×((q<sub>1</sub>×q<sub>2</sub>)/r<sup>2</sup>)</code>) which is [Coulomb's 
constant][] (k<sub>e</sub>) multiplied by the magnitudes of the two charges involved (q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub>) 
and divided by the square of the distance between the two objects (r<sup>2</sup>). This equation means that positive 
charges repel other positive charges, negative charges repel other negative charges, and positive charges attract 
negative charges (and vice versa).

Examples of electrically charged matter are protons, which are positively charged, and electrons, which are negatively 
charged. Protons and electrons have the same magnitude [elementary electric charge][], denoted 1e and -1e, 
respectively. Neutrons have no charge.

[Electromagnetic radiation][] represents [waves][] of an electromagnetic field traveling (radiating) through space. 
A wave represents something that repeats over time at a [frequency][] which is how often it repeats (a cycle) per unit 
time (e.g. one cycle per second). If the unit of time is one second, the unit of frequency is [Hertz][] (Hz). 
[Wavelength][] is the distance the wave covers over one cycle. The maximum speed of electromagntic radiation occurs in 
space without matter (a [vacuum][]) at the [speed of light][] (c), or approximately 3×10<sup>8</sup> m/s. The speed of 
light is the maximum speed that any matter can move.

# Energy

[Energy][] (E) is the amount of work one object performs on, or transfers to, another object. Energy is often measured 
in [joules][] (J). One joule can be defined as <code>J=N×m</code> or a force of one Newton acting on an object in the 
direction of its motion for one meter. Energy is either [kinetic energy][] if an object is in motion (in most simple 
cases expressed as <code>(m×v<sup>2</sup>)/2</code>); or, [potential energy][], which can be thought of as stored 
energy.

Energy can [neither be created nor destroyed][conservation of energy], but only transformed. Mass can be converted to 
energy and vice versa through the [mass-energy equivalence][] equation (<code>E=m×c<sup>2</sup></code>).

# Temperature

[Pressure][] (P) is the normal force per unit area (A) or <code>P=F<sub>n</sub>/A</code>, often measured in Pascals or 
N/m<sup>2</sup>. A system under pressure has potential energy.

[Atmospheric pressure][] is the pressure of a planet's atmosphere (e.g. the pressure of [air][]) on an object. The 
mass of air in the Earth's atmosphere [decreases expontentially altitude][earth air pressure] so the atmospheric 
pressure reduces expontentially as an object rises above [sea level][].

[Temperature][] is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a set of objects.

# Atoms

[Atoms][] are made of some number of [nucleons][] - at least one proton and zero or more neutrons - in the atom's 
[nucleus][], and some number of [electrons][] in [orbitals][] around the nucleus. An [atomic nucleus][atoms] is at least 
10<sup>-10</sup> m in diameter.

The number of protons is considered the [atomic number][] and categorizes the atom as a particular [element][] (e.g. 
carbon). The number of nucleons is considered the [atomic mass number][atomic mass]. The number of neutrons 
defines the element's [isotope][] which is represented as the element name followed by its atomic mass number (e.g. 
carbon-12). There are four main [states of matter][]: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.

If an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons, then it is [ionized][ion] (if positive, then it's 
named a cation, and if negative, an anion).

# Big History (Continued)

After the [Big Bang][], the universe was mostly made of hydrogen, helium, and lithium (the first three elements), some 
of which combined into plasma stars held together by [gravity][]. At high enough temperatures inside stars, 
hydrogen atoms undergo [nuclear fusion][] where nuclei (and their protons and neutrons) combine to produce 
[helium][stellar nucleosynthesis]. As the hydrogen is used up to create helium, the star's temperature rises and allows 
for the fusion of [helium into carbon and oxygen][triple alpha process] and some neon and heavier elements. As the star 
temperature continues to increase, nuclear fusion produces elements [up to iron][heavy elements]. The remaining 
elements in the universe are produced by [certain stars' s-processes][s process] and [stars' explosion in a supernova 
or collapse into a black hole or neutron star][r process].

# Chemistry

A [molecule][] is a set of two or more atoms held together by a [chemical bond][].

A [covalent bond][] occurs when two atoms share one or more electrons (the electron-electron and proton-proton 
repulsion is offset by the attraction between the two atoms' protons and electrons).

An [ionic bond][] occurs when oppositely charged ions attract each other (usually when electrons transfer from 
one atom to the other, causing ionization, and thus attraction).

An [organic compound][] is a molecule that has carbon.

# Biology

Biology is the [study of life][biology history]. The definition of life is [controversial][definition of life].

# History of Life

Oceans formed on Earth about [4.4 billion years ago][history of oceans].

# Cells

A [cell][] is a set of atoms encapsulated in a [membrane][], mostly filled with water. For example, a medium-sized E. 
coli cell has about [35 billion atoms][atoms in e coli] and a human body has about [10<sup>27</sup> atoms][atoms in 
human body].

An [organism][] is a set of one or more cells.
