# Purpose

The main purpose of this site is to summarize what I've learned because I find the process of summarizing helpful. The
second purpose is to share with and learn from others. Feel free to [correct or add things][issues].

# Biology

Biology is the [study of life][biology history]. The definition of life is [controversial][definition of life]. For me, 
life is something that reduces or counteracts [entropy][].

# Big History

The [universe][] is at least 13.7 billion years old and more than 100 billion [light years][] in diameter.

The planet [Earth][] (and its [solar system][]) formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's solar system is part 
of the [Milky Way galaxy][], which is at least 12 billion years old, contains over 100 billion stars and 100 billion 
planets, and is over 100,000 light years in diameter.

There are over 100 billion [galaxies][] in the universe.

# Matter

The universe is made of [matter][] which is something that has mass and takes up space, such as an [atom][].

Atoms are made of some number of nucleons (positively charged [protons][] and neutrally charged [neutrons][]) in the 
atom's [nucleus][], and some number of negatively charged [electrons][] in [orbitals][] around the nucleus. Protons and 
electrons have the same magnitude [elementary electric charge][], denoted 1e and -1e, respectively.

Protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 1.6×10<sup>−27</sup> kilograms (kg), whereas electrons have 
a much smaller relative mass (9.1×10<sup>−31</sup> kg), so the mass of an atom is considered the sum of the masses of 
the protons and neutrons, the total number of which is called the atomic mass.

Atoms are about 10<sup>-10</sup> meters in diameter.

If an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons, then it is an [ionized atom][ion] (either positively charged 
cations or negatively charged anions). The number of protons (its [atomic number][]) categorizes the atom as a 
particular [chemical element][] (e.g. carbon). The number of neutrons defines the element's [isotope][] (e.g. 
carbon-12). There are four main [states of matter][]: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.

# Chemistry

A [molecule][] is a set of two or more atoms held together by a [chemical bond][]. Protons are attracted to electrons, 
whereas electrons are repulsed to other electrons, and protons are repulsed to other protons.

An [electrovalent bond][] occurs when oppositely charged ions attract each other (usually when electrons transfer from 
one atom to the other, causing ionization, and thus attraction).

A [covalent bond][] occurs when two atoms share one or more electrons (the electron-electron and proton-proton repulsion 
is offset by the attraction between the two atoms' protons and electrons).

An [organic compound][] is a molecule that has carbon.

# Temperature

[Kinetic energy][] is the energy possessed due to motion. [Temperature][] is a measure of the average kinetic energy of 
a set of particles.

# Big History (Continued)

After the [Big Bang][], the universe was mostly made of hydrogen, helium, and lithium (the first three elements), some 
of which combined into plasma [stars][] held together by [gravity][]. At high enough temperatures inside stars, hydrogen 
atoms undergo [nuclear fusion][] where nuclei (and their protons and neutrons) combine to produce [helium][stellar 
nucleosynthesis]. As the hydrogen is used up to create helium, the star's temperature rises and allows for the fusion 
of [helium into carbon and oxygen][triple alpha process] and some neon and heavier elements. As the star temperature 
continues to increase, nuclear fusion produces elements [up to iron][heavy elements]. The remaining 
elements in the universe are produced by [certain stars' s-processes][s process] and [stars' explosion in a supernova or 
collapse into a black hole or neutron star][r process].

# History of Life

Oceans formed on Earth about [4.4 billion years ago][history of oceans].

# Cells

A [cell][] is a set of atoms encapsulated in a [membrane][], mostly filled with water. For example, a medium-sized E. 
coli cell has about [35 billion atoms][atoms in e coli] and a human body has about [10<sup>27</sup> atoms][atoms in 
human body].

An [organism][] is a set of one or more cells.
