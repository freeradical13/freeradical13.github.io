# Purpose

The main purpose of this site is to summarize what I've learned because I find the process of summarizing helpful. The
second purpose is to share with and learn from others. Feel free to
[correct or add things][issues].

# Biology

Biology is the [study of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology#History). The definition of life is
[controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life). For me, life is something that reduces or counteracts 
[entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_entropy).

# Big History

The [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) is at least 13.7 billion years old and more than 100 billion
[light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year) in diameter.

The planet [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) (and [its solar 
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System)) formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's solar system is part 
of the [Milky Way galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way), which is at least 12 billion years old, contains 
over 100 billion stars and 100 billion planets, and is over 100,000 light years in diameter.

There are over 100 billion [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy) in the universe.

# Matter

The universe is made of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) which is something that has mass and takes up
space, such as an [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms).

Atoms are made of some number of nucleons (positively charged [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton) and 
neutrally charged [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron)) in the atom's
[nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus), and some number of negatively charged 
[electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) in [orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital) around 
the nucleus. Protons and electrons have the same magnitude [elementary electric 
charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge), denoted 1e and -1e, respectively.

Protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 1.6×10<sup>−27</sup> kilograms (kg), whereas electrons have 
a much smaller relative mass (9.1×10<sup>−31</sup> kg), so the mass of an atom is considered the sum of the masses of 
the protons and neutrons, the total number of which is called the atomic mass.

Atoms are about 10<sup>-10</sup> meters in diameter.

If an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons, then it is an [ionized 
atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion) (either positively charged cations or negatively charged anions). The number 
of protons (its [atomic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number)) categorizes the atom as a particular 
[chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) (e.g. carbon). The number of neutrons defines the 
element's [isotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope) (e.g. carbon-12). There are four main [states of 
matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.

# Chemistry

A [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule) is a set of two or more atoms held together by a [chemical 
bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond). Protons are attracted to electrons, whereas electrons 
are repulsed to other electrons, and protons are repulsed to other protons.

An [electrovalent bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bonding) occurs when oppositely charged ions 
attract each other (usually when electrons transfer from one atom to the other, causing ionization, and thus 
attraction).

A [covalent bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond) occurs when two atoms share one or more 
electrons (the electron-electron and proton-proton repulsion is offset by the attraction between the two atoms' protons 
and electrons).

An [organic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound) is a molecule that has carbon.

# Temperature

[Kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy) is the energy possessed due to motion. 
[Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a set of 
particles.

# Big History (Continued)

After the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang), the universe was mostly made of hydrogen, helium, and 
lithium (the first three elements), some of which combined into plasma [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) held 
together by [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity). At high enough temperatures inside stars, hydrogen atoms 
undergo [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_fusion) where nuclei (and their protons and 
neutrons) combine to produce [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis). As the hydrogen is used up
to create helium, the star's temperature rises and allows for the fusion of [helium into carbon and 
oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process) and some neon and heavier elements. As the star temperature 
continues to increase, nuclear fusion produces elements [up to 
iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process#Nucleosynthesis_of_heavy_elements). The remaining elements in 
the universe are produced by [certain stars' s-processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process) and [stars' 
explosion in a supernova or collapse into a black hole or neutron star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process).

# History of Life

Oceans formed on Earth about [4.4 billion years 
ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth#Water_in_the_development_of_Earth).

# Cells

A [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) is a set of atoms encapsulated in a 
[membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane), mostly filled with water. For example, a medium-sized E. coli 
cell has about [35 billion atoms](http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-the-elemental-composition-of-a-cell/) and a human 
body has about [10<sup>27</sup> atoms](http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-the-elemental-composition-of-a-cell/).

An [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism) is a set of one or more cells.
