# Big History

The [universe][] is at least 13.7 billion years old and more than 100 billion [light years][] in [diameter][].

We live on [Earth][] which is part of a [solar system][] with a [star][] called the [Sun][]. Earth and its star formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's solar system is part of the [Milky Way galaxy][], which is at least 12 billion years old, contains over 100 billion stars and 100 billion [planets][], and is over 100,000 light years in diameter (or about 0.0001% of the size of the universe).

There are over 100 billion [galaxies][] in the universe.

# Basics

This page assumes basic knowledge of [math][], [algebra][], [geometry][], and [scientific notation][].

# Matter

The universe is made of [matter][] which is something that has [mass][] (m) and takes up a position in [space][].

Examples of matter are [protons][], [neutrons][], and [electrons][]. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 1.6×10<sup>−27</sup> [kilograms][] (kg), whereas electrons have a much smaller mass of about 9.1×10<sup>−31</sup> kg. [Protons][proton radius] and [neutrons][neutron radius] each have a [radius][] of about 0.8×10<sup>−15</sup> [meters][] (m), whereas electrons have a radius of less than [1.0×10<sup>−22</sup>][electron radius] m.

An [object][] (or [entity][] or [particle][]) is a collection of matter. An object has an [inertia][], meaning:

1. An object at rest will stay at rest unless a [force][] (F) is applied to push or pull it, and
2. An object in motion will stay in motion unless a force is applied to push or pull it.

The [speed][] of an object is a description of its movement which is the [rate][] at which its position in space changes over a [distance][] over a period of [time][] ([e.g.][for example] moving at 13 meters per [second][] (s), or 13 m/s).

The [velocity][] (v) of an object is a description of both its speed and its [direction][] in space (e.g. moving at 13 m/s _down_).

The [acceleration][] (a) of an object is the rate at which its velocity changes over a period of time (e.g. accelerating at 13 m/s over 1 second down, or 13 m/s<sup>2</sup> down).

The [momentum][] (p) of an object, or its "quantity of motion", is its mass multiplied by its velocity (<code>p=m×v</code>).

If the mass of an object is constant, the force acting on it is the [rate of change][derivative] of its momentum over time (<code>F=<span class="italics">d</span>p/<span class="italics">d</span>t</code>); or, substituting momentum for acceleration and simplifying, its mass multiplied by its acceleration (<code>F=m×a</code>). The unit of force is the [newton][] (N).

When objects touch each other, the [perpendicular][] force their surfaces apply is called the [normal force][] (F<sub>n</sub>), and any [parallel][] forces are called [frictional forces][] (F<sub>f</sub>).

When an object A exerts a force on another object B, then object B exerts an [equal and opposite force][force third law] on object A.

# Electric Charge

[Electric charge][] is the property of some forms of matter to create an [electromagnetic field][] which applies a positive or negative force on other electrically charged matter, proportional to the distance between them. The magnitude of the force (named the electrostatic force) is calculated with [Coulomb's law][] (<code>F=k<sub>e</sub>×((q<sub>1</sub>×q<sub>2</sub>)/r<sup>2</sup>)</code>) which is [Coulomb's constant][] (k<sub>e</sub>) multiplied by the magnitudes of the two charges involved (q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub>) and divided by the square of the distance between the two objects (r<sup>2</sup>). This equation means that positive charges repel other positive charges, negative charges repel other negative charges, and positive charges attract negative charges (and vice versa).

Examples of electrically charged matter are protons, which are positively charged, and electrons, which are negatively charged. Protons and electrons have the same magnitude [elementary electric charge][], denoted 1e and -1e, respectively. Neutrons have no charge (electrically neutral).

An electromagnetic field creates [electromagnetic radiation][] which is a [wave][] of its force traveling (radiating) through space. A wave represents something that repeats over time at a [frequency][] which is how often it repeats (a cycle) per unit time (e.g. one cycle per second). If the unit of time is one second, the unit of frequency is [Hertz][] (Hz). [Wavelength][] is the distance a wave covers over one cycle. The maximum speed of electromagntic radiation occurs in space without matter (a [vacuum][]) at the [speed of light][] (c), or approximately 3×10<sup>8</sup> m/s. The speed of light is the maximum speed that any matter may move.

# Energy

[Energy][] (E) is the amount of work one object performs on, or transfers to, another object. Energy is often measured in [joules][] (J). One joule may be defined as <code>J=N×m</code> or a force of one Newton acting on an object in the direction of its motion for one meter.

Energy is either [kinetic energy][] if an object is in motion (in most simple cases expressed as <code>(m×v<sup>2</sup>)/2</code>); or, [potential energy][], which may be thought of as stored energy.

Energy may [neither be created nor destroyed][conservation of energy], but only transformed. Mass may be converted to energy and vice versa through the [mass-energy equivalence][] equation (<code>E=m×c<sup>2</sup></code>).

# Pressure and Temperature

[Pressure][] (P) is the normal force per unit area (A) applied to an object or <code>P=F<sub>n</sub>/A</code>, often measured in [Pascals][] (Pa) (in N/m<sup>2</sup>). An object under pressure has potential energy.

[Atmospheric pressure][] is the pressure of a planet's atmosphere (e.g. the pressure of [air][]) on an object. The mass of air in the Earth's atmosphere [decreases expontentially with altitude][earth air pressure] so the atmospheric pressure decreases expontentially as an object rises above [sea level][].

Another unit of pressure is the [atmosphere][atm] (atm) which is the pressure on Earth at sea level and it's equivalent to 101,325 Pa.

[Temperature][] is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a set of objects. [Absolute zero][] is the coldest state at which an object has minimal movement; however, practically, it may be assumed that all objects have some movement (or [vibration][]) and thus some non-zero temperature.

Temperature or heat is either measured in [degrees][] (°) of change on the scale of [Celsius][] (°C) or [Fahrenheit][] (°F), or in absolute terms on the scale of [Kelvin][] (K).

Roughly, the scale of celsius is defined with 0°C being when water freezes at 1 atm, 100°C when water boils at 1 atm, and absolute zero is -273.15°C. The scale of fahrenheit is defined with 32°F being when water freezes at 1 atm, 212°F when water boils at 1 atm, and absolute zero is -459.67°F. Originally, the Kelvin scale was defined relative to Celsius, but is now defined as pressure invariant, with 0 as absolute zero, and 273.16K when water reaches its [triple point][]. Kelvin was designed so that an increase of one Kelvin is equal to an increase of 1°C.

The [lowest recorded surface temperature][temperature comparison] on Earth is <code>184K / -89.2°C / -128.6°F</code>, the highest <code>331K / 58°C / 136.4°F</code>, and the average <code>288K / 15°C / 59°F</code>.

All matter above absolute zero temperature continuously emits some of its kinetic energy as [photons][] of electromagnetic radiation called [thermal radiation][] or heat. The temperature determines the [emission spectrum][] of wavelengths of the electromagnetic radiation. Most matter may also absorb some of the incoming electromagnetic radiation.

If two objects touch with a path permeable to heat, then, all else being equal, the hotter object heats the cooler object through [thermal conduction][] (and [thermal convection][] in the case of fluids and gases) until they (or at least their touching surfaces) reach [thermal equilibrium][].

# Atoms

[Atoms][] are made of some number of [nucleons][] - at least one proton and zero or more neutrons - in the atom's [nucleus][], and zero or more [electrons][] orbiting the nucleus in [shells][electron shells]. Shells are subdivided into [subshells][electron subshells]. Subshells are subdivided into [orbitals][].

The number of nucleons is considered the [atomic mass number][] (A) since an atom's electrons' masses are so much relatively lighter than the nucleons' masses.

The number of protons is considered the [atomic number][] (Z) and categorizes the atom in a class called a [chemical element][] (e.g. Carbon is the chemical element class for any atom which has 6 protons; an atom is an instance of the chemical element). Chemical elements and their reactions are the basis of chemistry.

The number of neutrons defines the element's [isotope][] which is represented as the element name followed by its atomic mass number (e.g. Carbon-14), so the number of neutrons may be deduced from the isotope name by subtracting the number of protons. An isotope may be abbreviated with the atomic mass number in a superscript to the left of the element symbol; for example, <sup>14</sup>C for Carbon-14.

[Atomic mass][] (m<sub>A</sub>) is measured in [unified atomic mass units][] (u or amu), also known as daltons (Da) and 1u is approximately the mass of a nucleon. For various reasons, 1u is defined more strictly as <code>1/12</code> of the mass of a Carbon-12 atom. [Relative atomic mass][] (A<sub>r</sub>) is a ratio of the average mass of atoms of an element in some sample to 1u. [Standard atomic weight][] (A<sub>r,std</sub>) is A<sub>r</sub> on Earth, reflecting the weighted average of isotope masses of an element on Earth.

If an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons, then it is electrically neutral. If an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons, then it is [ionized][ion]. If an atom has more protons than electrons, then it's positively electrically charged, called a cation, and symbolized as E<sup>+</sup> (where E is the element symbol, discussed below). If an atom has more electrons than protons, then it's negatively electrically charged, called an anion, and symbolized as E<sup>-</sup>. If the ion is more than one electron away from the neutral element, then the <sup>+</sup> or <sup>-</sup> is preceded by that number, e.g. E<sup>2+</sup>.

# Chemistry

## The Periodic Table of Elements

The [periodic table][] is a way to organize and understand the chemical elements based on observed patterns. The elements are ordered by atomic number (number of protons) from left to right, and starting again at the left when going down.

Within each square, the atomic number is at the top, followed by the element's symbol, followed by the element name, followed by its standard atomic weight (A<sub>r,std</sub>):

[![periodic table element](images/periodic_table_element.png)](images/periodic_table_element.png)

[![32-column periodic table](images/32-column_periodic_table-a_modified.png)][periodic table image]

<div style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0; text-align: right; font-size: xx-small;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:32-column_periodic_table-a.png">Based on an image by Sandbh</a></div>

The main reason for describing elements in such a way has to do with [electron configuration][] patterns and the behaviors they may cause (described later).

Rows are called periods and describe a new electron shell which accumulates on top of any previous periods' shells. This outermost shell is known as the [valence shell][] which generally contains the [valence electrons][] that may be reactive (ionized elements complicate this picture since they contain one less electron and effectively drop down a shell - for example, the Lithium cation - but the table is a conceptual starting point from neutral atoms).

Columns are called groups and generally group by the number of valence electrons, and thus generally group by similar behavior.

Each electron shell in an atom has a maximum number of electrons (<code>2×Shell_Number<sup>2</sup></code>) before the next shell starts. Each shell has a distinct [energy level][] and is broken down into subshells which have a maximum number of electrons before the next subshell starts. Each subshell is broken down into orbitals of [up to 2 electrons][orbitalmax2e] each. Electron configurations are represented by the accumulation of subshells up to the total number of electrons, with each subshell described by the shell number, followed by the subshell name, followed by the number of electrons in that subshell in a superscript. The subshell names are:

* s: For groups 1 and 2 (or group 18 for Helium) only, at most 2 electrons.
* p: Starting at period 2, for groups 13-18 only, at most 6 electrons.
* d: Starting at period 4, for groups 3-12 only, at most 10 electrons.
* f: Starting at period 6, in between groups 3 and 4 only, at most 14 electrons.
* [...]

Examples of electron configurations for the first 11 neutral elements:

<pre>
Hydrogen (1):  1s<sup>1</sup>
Helium (2):    1s<sup>2</sup>
Lithium (3):   1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>1</sup>
Beryllium (4): 1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup>
Boron (5):     1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>1</sup>
Carbon (6):    1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>2</sup>
Nitrogen (7):  1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>3</sup>
Oxygen (8):    1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>4</sup>
Florine (9):   1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>5</sup>
Neon (10):     1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>6</sup>
Sodium (11):   1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>6</sup> 3s<sup>1</sup>
[...]
</pre>

Instead of writing the full details of long electron configurations, a common practice is to start with the previous group 18 element in [brackets] followed by the rest of the element's electron configuration. For example, Sodium (element #11) may be written as [Ne] 3s<sup>1</sup>.

When d and f orbitals are filled, they backfill the previous shell. For example, Scandium's (element #21) electron configuration is [Ar] 4s<sup>2</sup> 3d<sup>1</sup>.

The electrons that tend to cause an atom to chemically react are those electrons with the highest energies (the farthest distances from the nucleus) and are usually those in the valence shell. The exceptions are elements with d or f orbitals because even though those backfill the previous, non-valence shell, they may have higher energies than the s orbital electrons of the valence shell; however, these energies decrease moving right on a period, so the number of these valence electrons is limited.

Generally, atoms tend to be chemically reactive when their valence electrons do not complete their valence shell and thus the atom is unstable. For example, Hydrogen is unstable because it wants one more electron to complete its shell. All elements above period 1 generally want 8 electrons in their valance shell and this heuristic is called the [octet rule][]. Atoms tend to gain, shed, or share pairs of electrons as needed to reach a full and stable set of valence electrons. This is one of the most important aspects of chemistry and means that groups have generally similar behaviors since they're generally grouped by the number of valence electrons. There are 18 numbered and 6 named groups for convenience:

* Group #1: [Alkali metals][] - Highly reactive because they want to lose an electron to drop to the previous period's full set of valence electrons.
* Group #2: [Alkaline earth metals][] - Somewhat reactive because they want to lose two electrons to drop to the previous period's full set of valence electrons.
* Group #15: [Pnictogens][]
* Group #16: [Chalcogens][] - Somewhat reactive because they want to gain two electrons or share pairs of electrons to fill their set of valance electrons.
* Group #17: [Halogens][] - Highly reactive because they want to gain an electron or share a pair of electrons to fill their set of of valence electrons.
* Group #18: [Noble gases][] - Generally not chemically reactive ([inert][]) because the set of valence electrons is full.

The radius of an atom increases from top to bottom as electron shells are added; however, moving left to right, the radius of an atom decreases as the additional protons draw in the electrons.

[Ionization energy][] (or cationization energy) is the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from an element (and form a cation). Energy is required to remove the electron because the electron is attracted to its element's proton(s). Following from the octet rule, ionization energy is lowest on the left of the table because those elements want to lose electron(s) to achieve a full set of valence electrons, and [ionization energy generally increases from left to right][ionization energy increases right] as additional protons add more pull to the electrons. Ionization energy decreases from top to bottom because valence electrons are farther from the protons (to which they're attracted) and thus the electrons are easier to peel off.

[Electron affinity][] (or anionization energy) is either:

1. The amount of energy released when an electron is added to an incomplete set of valence electrons. Energy is released because any time an electron drops into a new orbital, it causes the release of electromagnetic radiation energy in the form of a photon. Or,
1. The amount of energy spent adding an electron to create a new subshell or adding an electron to a subshell which only has a single electron in each of its orbital pairs (e.g. Nitrogen). Energy is needed to overcome the last subshell's stability.

Generally, electron affinity increases from left to right (except for those with stable last subshells) because right-most elements want additional electrons to achieve stability.

Most elements are [metals][] (although only two are named metal groups): they are toward the left side of the periodic table (with the exception of Hydrogen), have low ionization energies, low electron affinity, are highly [electrically conductive][], [ductile][], and generally solid at standard temperature.

[Nonmetals][] are the opposite of metals: they are toward the right side of the table (with the exception of Hydrogen), have high ionization energies, high electron affinities, are not very electrically conductive, and they are often gases (e.g. Hydrogen, Helium, etc.), although some are brittle solids (e.g. Carbon).

There are a handful of [Metalloids][] which have properties of both metals and nonmetals and run down a diagonal in the p-block (e.g. Boron, Silicon, etc.).

A [transition metal][] is any element with a partially filled d sub-shell (groups 3-11).

# Big History (Continued)

After the [Big Bang][], the universe was mostly made of hydrogen, helium, and lithium (the first three elements), some of which combined into plasma stars held together by [gravity][]. At high enough temperatures inside stars, hydrogen atoms undergo [nuclear fusion][] where nuclei (and their protons and neutrons) combine to produce [helium][stellar nucleosynthesis]. As the hydrogen is used up to create helium, the star's temperature rises and allows for the fusion of [helium into carbon and oxygen][triple alpha process] and some neon and heavier elements. As the star temperature continues to increase, nuclear fusion produces elements [up to iron][heavy elements]. The remaining elements in the universe are produced by [certain stars' s-processes][s process] and [stars' explosions in a supernova or collapses into a black hole or neutron star][r process].

# Chemistry (Continued)

[Molecules][] and [chemical compounds][] are sets of two or more atoms held together by a [chemical bond][] because the atoms are more [stable][molecule stability] with that bond.

Types of chemical bonds:

1. A molecule exists when a [covalent bond][] occurs where atoms share one or more pairs of electrons in their valence shells. For example, Hydrogen wants to gain an electron and Oxygen wants to gain two electrons, so it's common for two Hydrogens to each share their electron with one of the valence electrons in the Oxygen to form an Oxygen bonded with two Hydrogens, or water. A molecule is considered a compound if it's made of more than one type of element.
1. An [ionic compound][] or [salt][] exists when an [ionic bond][] occurs where one atom transfers electron(s) to another, creating a cation and anion, which may then cause electrostatic attraction of the oppositely charged ions. For example, the alkali metal Sodium (Na) wants to lose an electron, and the halogen Chlorine (Cl) wants to gain an electron, so Na may give its electron to Cl, thus making Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> and then those two ions may bond due to the electrostatic force, forming NaCl (otherwise known as table salt).
1. An [intermetallic compound][] exists when a [metallic bond][] occurs where a set of cations share a sea of free electrons.

A [chemical substance][] is a set of one or more elements, molecules or compounds of the same composition (i.e. "pure"). A substance cannot be separated through physical means other than breaking chemical bonds (interpret the [venn diagram][] by the location of the bond arrows):

[![substance terms](images/substance_terms.png)](images/substance_terms.png)

A [mixture][] is a combination of different substances which cannot be separated through physical means. Therefore, an object is either a substance or a mixture.

A [molecular entity][] is a single instance of a part of a molecule, such as an atom, ion, or molecule. A set of identical molecular entities (in other words, a class of molecular entities) is a [chemical species][]. For example, a single water molecule is a molecular entity, but all the instances of a water molecule in some context is a chemical species. Relatedly, an [elementary entity][] is similar to a molecular entity but may also be an electron, particle, or group of particles.

A substance may be described in many ways, all of which may represent either an entity or a species:

1. A [molecular formula][] describes the number of atoms of each element in each molecule in a subscript to the right of the element symbol (or 1 if the subscript is omitted). For example, the molecule H<sub>2</sub>O represents two Hydrogen atoms bonded with one Oxygen atom.
1. An [empirical formula][] is the molecular formula with the ratios of elements reduced to the simplest form. For example, a molecule of [Benzene][] has a molecular formula of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, but the empirical formula is CH.
1. A [trivial][trivial name] or [retained name][]; for example, Water represents H<sub>2</sub>O (in the case of water, the molecular and empirical formulas are the same).
1. Various [structural formulas][] that describe the two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure of the molecule.
1. An ionic compound name (or systematic name) with a set of element names with any cation first; for example, Sodium Chloride. If the cation is a transition metal, then it may be followed by roman numerals in parentheses ([type-I compounds][], [type-II compounds][] or [type-III compounds][]) which represents the net positive charge of that cation; for example, Iron(III) Oxide is Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> because the III means that Iron is Fe<sup>3+</sup> and gave 3 extra electrons, and since each Oxygen atom needs two electrons, there should be two Iron atoms, making 6 extra electrons, which means there are three Oxygen atoms, each taking 2 of those 6 extra electrons.

[Electronegativity][] is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons to its valence shell (closely related to electron affinity). It follows from the octet rule that atoms increase in electronegativity from left to right. Electronegativity decreases from top to bottom because the valence shell is farther away from the positively charged nucleus and thus there's less pull to bring in additional electrons. Electropositivity is the opposite of electronegativity.

In summary, although with various exceptions, the broad trends of atomic size, ionization energy, electron affinity and metallic character may be visualized as:

[![Periodic trends](images/Periodic_trends.jpg)][periodic trends image]

When an element is anionized with one additional electron, the suffix of its name changes to -ide. The suffix -ate means more, and -ite means fewer. The prefix per- means one more, and hypo- means one fewer.

There are ~6.022140857×10<sup>23</sup> ([Avogadro constant][]) atoms in 12g of <sup>12</sup>C. A [mole][] (mol) is defined as the number of elementary entities in a substance as there are atoms in 12g of <sup>12</sup>C. Therefore, <code>1 mol <sup>12</sup>C = 12g</code>. Since 1u is 1/12<sup>th</sup> the mass of one <sup>12</sup>C atom, then <code>1 mol 1u = 1g</code>; therefore, <code>1 mol of isotope <sup>m<sub>A</sub></sup>E ~= m<sub>A</sub> grams</code>. If a substance doesn't refer to a particular isotope, then standard atomic weight (A<sub>r,std</sub>) is generally used instead of m<sub>A</sub>. For example, A<sub>r,std</sub> of H is 1.008, and A<sub>r,std</sub> of O is 15.999, so <code>1 mol H<sub>2</sub>O ~= (1.008×2)g + 15.999g ~= 18.015g</code>. The [molar mass][] (M) of a substance is simply this relationship in terms of g/mol, so M(H<sub>2</sub>O) ~= 18.015 g/mol. [Molecular mass][] is simply the sum of atomic masses of a molecule, so in the previous example, the molecular mass of water is 18.015u.

In general, matter exists in one of [four states][state of matter]:

* [Solid][]: Matter which has fixed volume and fixed shape, with its components close together and fixed in place. In equations, solid substances may be suffixed with (s).
* [Liquid][]: Matter which has fixed volume and variable shape to fit its container, with its components close together but not fixed in place. In equations, liquid substances may be suffixed with (l).
* [Gas][]: Matter which has variable volume and variable shape, both to fit its container, and its components are neither close together nor fixed in place. In equations, gas substances may be suffixed with (g).
* [Plasma][]: Matter which has variable volume and variable shape, but also contains a large number of ions or electrons moving freely.

## Chemical Reactions

A [chemical reaction][] occurs any time a chemical bond is created or broken. A [chemical equation][] describes a reaction with [reagents][] (or reactants) on the left-hand side of the equation which yields (→) the [product(s)][chemical reaction product] of the chemical reaction on the right-hand side of the equation. For example, the chemical equation for the reaction of molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen plus input energy (E) yields water and output energy E':

<code>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + E → 2H<sub>2</sub>O + E'</code>

Reactions that don't require input energy are called [spontaneous][spontaneous reactions].

A coefficient to the left of a substance represents the number of substances or moles of that species in the chemical reaction. A chemical equation must be balanced using [stoichiometry][] because the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides.

Chemical reactions may also be [reversible][reversible reaction] and go in both directions, signified by a double arrow (⇌), until reaching [chemical equilibrium][] when the rates of reactions in both directions are equal. For example:

<code>HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> ⇌ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></code>

Given a balanced chemical equation and the relationship of moles to atomic weights, and a mass of one substance, composition stoichiometry may be used to determine the mass of other substances in the equation. [For example][example composition stoichiometry], in the following equation:

<code>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2Al → Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2Fe</code>

If we know there are 85g of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, since each of those molecules is about 160u, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is about 160g/mol, so first convert 85g to moles using [dimensional analysis][] by multiplying by 1mol/160g to cancel the g, and therefore, 85g divided by 160g/mol is 0.53 mols. Since there are two moles of Al for every 1 mole of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, <code>2×0.53 = 1.06 mols</code> of Al would be needed to react with all of the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Given Al's atomic weight is about 27u, 1 mole is about 27g, so <code>1.06×27 = 28.62g</code> of Al would be needed to react with all of the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
