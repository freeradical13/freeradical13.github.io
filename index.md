# Purpose

The main purpose of this site is to summarize what I've learned because I find the process of summarizing helpful. The
second purpose is to share with and learn from others. Feel free to [correct or add things][issues].

# Big History

The [universe][] is at least 13.7 billion years old and more than 100 billion [light years][] in [diameter][].

The planet [Earth][] (and its [solar system][]) formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's solar system is part 
of the [Milky Way galaxy][], which is at least 12 billion years old, contains over 100 billion stars and 100 billion 
planets, and is over 100,000 light years in diameter.

There are over 100 billion [galaxies][] in the universe.

# Matter

The universe is made of [matter][] which is something that has [mass][] (m) and takes up a position in [space][].

Examples of matter are [protons][], [electrons][], and [neutrons][]. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of about 
[1.6×10<sup>−27</sup>][scientific notation] [kilograms][] (kg), whereas electrons have a much smaller mass of about 
9.1×10<sup>−31</sup> kg. [Protons][proton radius] and [neutrons][neutron radius] each have a [radius][] of about 
0.8×10<sup>−15</sup> [meters][] (m), whereas electrons have a radius of less than [1.0×10<sup>−22</sup>][electron 
radius].

An [object][] is a collection of matter. An object has an [inertia][], meaning:

1. An object at rest will stay at rest unless a [force][] (F) is applied to push or pull it, and
2. An object in motion will stay in motion in a straight line unless a force is applied to push or pull it.

Matter has a [speed][] of movement which is the [rate][] at which its position in space changes over a [distance][] over 
a period of [time][] ([e.g.][for example] moving at 13 meters per [second][] (s) or moving at 13 m/s). The [velocity][] 
(v) of matter is a description of both its speed and its [direction][] in space (e.g. moving at 13 m/s down). The 
[acceleration][] (a) of matter is the rate at which its velocity changes over a period of time (e.g. accelerating at 13 
m/s over 1 second, or 13 m/s<sup>2</sup>). The [momentum][] (p) of matter, or "quantity of motion", is its mass 
multiplied by its velocity (p=m×v).

If the mass of an object is constant, the force acting on it is the [rate of change][derivative] of its momentum over 
time (F=dp/dt); or, substituting momentum for acceleration and simplifying, its mass multiplied by its acceleration 
(F=m×a).

When an object A exerts a force on another object B, then object B exerts an [equal and opposite force][force third 
law] on object A.

# Electric Charge

[Electric charge][] is the property of some forms of matter to apply a positive or negative force on other electrically 
charged matter. The magnitude of the force is calculated with [Coulomb's law][] which is Coulomb's constant multiplied 
by the magnitudes of the two charges involved and divided by the square of the distance between the two [particles][], 
meaning that the force is [inversely proportional][] to the square of the distance. This equation also implies that 
positive charges repel other positive charges, negative charges repel other negative charges, and positive charges 
attract negative charges.

Examples of electrically charged matter are protons, which are positively charged, and electrons, which are negatively 
charged. Protons and electrons have the same magnitude [elementary electric charge][], denoted 1e and -1e, 
respectively. Neutrons have no charge.

# Atoms

[Atoms][] are made of some number of [nucleons][] - protons and neutrons - in the atom's [nucleus][], and some number of 
[electrons][] in [orbitals][] around the nucleus. An [atomic nucleus][atoms] is at least 10<sup>-10</sup> m in diameter.

The number of protons is considered the [atomic number][] and categorizes the atom as a particular [element][] (e.g. 
carbon). The number of nucleons is considered the [atomic mass number][atomic mass]. The number of neutrons 
defines the element's [isotope][] which is represented as the element name followed by its atomic mass number (e.g. 
carbon-12). There are four main [states of matter][]: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.

If an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons, then it is [ionized][ion] (if positive, then it's 
named a cation, and if negative, an anion).

# Chemistry

A [molecule][] is a set of two or more atoms held together by a [chemical bond][].

A [covalent bond][] occurs when two atoms share one or more electrons (the electron-electron and proton-proton 
repulsion is offset by the attraction between the two atoms' protons and electrons).

An [ionic bond][] occurs when oppositely charged ions attract each other (usually when electrons transfer from 
one atom to the other, causing ionization, and thus attraction).

An [organic compound][] is a molecule that has carbon.

# Temperature

[Kinetic energy][] is the energy possessed due to motion. [Temperature][] is a measure of the average kinetic energy of 
a set of particles.

# Big History (Continued)

After the [Big Bang][], the universe was mostly made of hydrogen, helium, and lithium (the first three elements), some 
of which combined into plasma [stars][] held together by [gravity][]. At high enough temperatures inside stars, hydrogen 
atoms undergo [nuclear fusion][] where nuclei (and their protons and neutrons) combine to produce [helium][stellar 
nucleosynthesis]. As the hydrogen is used up to create helium, the star's temperature rises and allows for the fusion 
of [helium into carbon and oxygen][triple alpha process] and some neon and heavier elements. As the star temperature 
continues to increase, nuclear fusion produces elements [up to iron][heavy elements]. The remaining 
elements in the universe are produced by [certain stars' s-processes][s process] and [stars' explosion in a supernova or 
collapse into a black hole or neutron star][r process].

# Biology

Biology is the [study of life][biology history]. The definition of life is [controversial][definition of life].

# History of Life

Oceans formed on Earth about [4.4 billion years ago][history of oceans].

# Cells

A [cell][] is a set of atoms encapsulated in a [membrane][], mostly filled with water. For example, a medium-sized E. 
coli cell has about [35 billion atoms][atoms in e coli] and a human body has about [10<sup>27</sup> atoms][atoms in 
human body].

An [organism][] is a set of one or more cells.
